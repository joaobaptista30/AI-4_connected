# Connect 4 with Monte Carlo Tree Search

## üéØ Project Overview
This project implements the classic **Connect 4 game**, with:

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** An interactive and user-friendly design to play the game.  
- **AI Opponent (MCTS):** A Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm that makes strategic decisions, providing a challenging gameplay experience.  

The goal is to demonstrate the integration of **game logic** and **artificial intelligence techniques** to better understand Monte Carlo methods.

## üß† How the AI Works (MCTS)
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is used as the decision-making algorithm:

- **Selection:** Traverse the game tree using UCT (Upper Confidence Bound for Trees).  
- **Expansion:** Add new nodes for unexplored moves.  
- **Simulation:** Play random games until reaching a terminal state.  
- **Backpropagation:** Update win/visit counts for all visited nodes.  

This process balances **exploration** (trying new moves) and **exploitation** (choosing moves that worked in the past).
